"During your Saturn return, you are a teenager and the planet of discipline is your dad, barging into your room checking to see if you’ve done your homework. If the assignment is complete, you are rewarded. But along with this accolade comes a warning: you can’t rest on your laurels. You must keep going to maintain your status. On the flip side, if you haven’t done the work, you still have to learn those lessons. What you’ve been avoiding catches up with you—Saturn doesn’t let you get away with it anymore; you must correct the course. For many, the Saturn return aligns with fulfilling milestones: weddings, giving birth or promotions. For others, it lines up with unnerving shakeups: cross-country moves, career changes or heartbreaking breakups. However the transit manifests for you, you can’t escape this total renovation of your life. It’s a rite of passage; it’s a time to grow up. Saturn rewards diligence. So, as your Saturn return approaches, identify what isn’t working in your life as well as what you’re willing to fight to hold onto. It’s impossible to completely prepare for this transit. You can’t outsmart Saturn, but if you pay attention, Saturn will prepare you for the next 30 years of your life. It’s like a bootcamp, you only get out of it what you’re willing to put in."
"The Saturn Return is a wake-up call, and this is why so many fear it's sobering realities. If you've spent your twenties in a fog, coasting on your youthful charm, it becomes obvious that your foundation is too flimsy for the long haul. When you're young, there seems infinite time to decide what you want to be ""when you grow up."" Well, Father Time swoops down as you're nearing 30 to say, you're all grown up now, pick a path. Sometimes we make life choices before we really know who we are. At the Saturn return, some of these choices are revealed to be out of sync with our true destiny. And it's a big deal, since there may be marriages and whole careers up for review. The U.S. Census reports a peak of divorces around age 30 when promises made in the blush of youth don't match the core of either person as they approach this turning point. On the other hand, Saturn may bring a fated relationship, that leads to a serious commitment with long-term potential.​ The Saturn return brings with it the pressure of time, and often the first awareness of your own mortality. You take stock of what it would take to achieve those big dreams, and often a sense of dread at ever getting there. But happily, it's a time when things like discipline, focus, and clear-sight come in to give you a kind of pragmatic hope. You'll figure out what's still possible, and make the changes necessary to get on track. The Saturn return often creates a crisis that puts you face-to-face with your fears. And many of these have deep roots in your psyche, but they're also about living up to societal expectations. Saturn causes a mini earthquake to the foundations, and this enables you to shake off what's not really You. Saturn's other alias is Lord of Karma, and here's the test of whether you can become your own authority. Can you discover an unshakable core self within you that will be the basis for a lifetime of growth? Saturn has been known as the Great Malefic, whose transits are met with dread. But Saturn is simply the instigator of change, all meant to lead you toward healing and a real foundation of self. If you're in your Saturn return, and finding it hard to cope, get used to letting go of what's not working. When you hold on to things that Saturn is trying to break up, that's when the suffering is compounded. The Saturn return makes it clear what you've been up to for the last 29 or so years. Some ""old souls"" that made wise choices from the get-go may find it to be a passage where things are solidified. Not all marriages fall apart, and some grow stronger when they make it through this maturation phase together. If you resist the changes that Saturn brings, there's always the second go-round. But that isn't advised since it might be a farther fall to the bottom. The example of a Saturn resister would be someone devoted to a job that makes them miserable or stuck in a relationship that's harmful to their spirit. Just like the I-Ching says, chaos is another name for opportunity. And listening to the pressures and doubts of your Saturn return brings on the breakdown before the breakthrough. Saturn is trying to lead you to yourself."
"The effects of the return itself can typically be felt the entire time Saturn is in the same sign it was when you were born, usually a period of about two and a half years that will fall sometime between ages 27 and 30. During this period, you’ll be faced with challenges, and questions about the life you’re living and the life you want. Saturn returns feel particularly demanding because of the nature of Saturn itself. It’s the planet of structure and duty, of limits and mortality. Even in normal times, its energy can feel rigorous and exacting. It isn’t malicious or bad, but it isn’t always easily borne, either. During a return, Saturn’s energy can pull at you in an even more intense way than usual. It might ask you to know yourself in ways you haven’t so far. It might ask you to set limits for yourself. It might ask you to accept a new heaviness, a new maturity, a new sense of responsibility. Saturn’s themes tend to sound unpleasant, or at least less fun than most of the other planets. While Venus, for example, famously rules love and money, and lucky Jupiter is the planet of goodwill and abundance, Saturn is sometimes talked about as though it’s the planetary incarnation of the police or the repressive state or a domineering dad. It’s easy to view Saturn as the planet of the status quo, and Saturn’s first return as the time to mark your entry into conventional adulthood by getting married or buying a house. But this isn’t the only way to think about it. Part of the Saturn’s real gift is a rest from the constant drive in our world for endless positivity and constant wild exploration. Saturn’s energy can help you to grapple with feelings of doubt or exhaustion. When Saturn returns, it’s a time for making a commitment to the way you want to live and to the work you want to do, conventional or ambitious or strange."
"Because Saturn is associated with discipline, hard work, and sacrifice, its return is sort of like the moment when a stern schoolteacher walks back into a chaotic classroom — if that moment lasted roughly three years. This planet is here to whip you into shape, throwing career challenges, relationship upheavals, and other structural changes in your path. And yes, you'll feel its effects for years. Anything that has to do with your long-term success and longevity is fair game to Saturn — from your natal placement, it will call upon you to reevaluate the systems that govern your life in order to either improve upon them or shed them and start from scratch. As you might have guessed, Saturn returns can be difficult (and, since they occur with Saturn's orbit, you can look forward to another one around your 60th birthday, too). But, they aren't without their benefits. A breakup might lead to you finding yourself. A layoff might prompt a career path epiphany. Whatever the silver lining is, just know that it will exist. Saturn is a tough teacher, but it won't leave you completely high and dry."
"Saturn in astrology is all about tough love and hard work. This planet represents responsibility, discipline, boundaries, structure, patience, and maturity — during your Saturn return, all of these things will be put to the test. Saturn is known as the great teacher planet in astrology, so when it completes its first full orbit during your late twenties, expect for some harsh life lessons to be learned — and some major growth to take place. Saturn returns shake up the foundation of our lives, exposing all our weak points and immaturities. Suddenly seeing your life in all its messiness can feel scary and unstable, but the blessing of this chaos is that you're seeing things clearly — which means you can start to patch up the holes in your life and take responsibility for yourself in a more mature and powerful way. With Saturn realigning itself with your natal placement, expect a full-blown reckoning and crisis point. It's normal to feel overwhelmed by personal issues and responsibilities during this period, but now's the time to learn to face these challenges head-on. If you're living your life in a way that's inauthentic to you (such as staying in a toxic relationship or dead-end job), honor the voice inside your heart that's screaming for change. While taking a leap of faith can be scary, your Saturn return asks that you put in the hard work needed to be true to yourself. The planet Saturn rewards hard work, diligence, and patience, and frowns upon shortcuts or temporary fixes. In other words, the more we repress the inner turmoil that bubbles up during this period, the messier it will get. It's also a time to own up the responsibilities in your life. Is it time to take out a credit card? Make that therapy appointment? Start that business? Quit that job? Say yes to the dress? Whether you're teetering on the edge of committing to something or abandoning it, your Saturn return asks you to be mature and responsible in your decision-making — and to brave the internal struggles that come along with making such pivotal life choices. Saturn returns can be riddled with instability, second-guessing, and risk-taking, but you'll come out the other side with a new sense of responsibility, confidence, and trust in yourself."
"Saturn will give you very clear signals if you're not aligned with your calling and pursuing your passions. Feeling stuck, depressed, frustrated and/or jealous of other people's careers are signs that it's time for a change. Those who ignore the signs and resist change could be forced by circumstances into a new line of work. Saturn is the ""tough love"" planet, whose lessons can feel harsh. However, whatever losses you experience during your Saturn Return are really helping you in the long run, compelling you to come into integrity with your truth. Because your Saturn Return is typically a time when you have to ""make your own luck,"" don't expect work opportunities to come falling out of the sky. Be willing to be humble and start small. If you're interested in pursuing a new path and don't yet have the experience to land a paying job, then volunteer your time. If you can't afford to go back to school full-time, start by taking a class at a community college. When you demonstrate your commitment to your goal by taking one concrete step in that direction, Saturn will reward your effort. If you're willing to work hard, take responsibility, face your fears and let go of the past, your Saturn Return can be a time of major achievement. The Saturn Return is a time of significant endings and beginnings, and relationships are no exception -- both weddings and divorces are common. This is a ""make it or break it"" transit, when you are ready to commit, one way or the other, and when you will receive clear signals to guide you. If you're already in a partnership at the start of your Saturn Return, the relationship will be tested. The Saturn Return calls for personal growth and major life changes, and your partnership will also have to grow and change if it is to survive. Now is the time to address any issues that have been lurking beneath the surface, and to take responsibility for making necessary adjustments in how you relate. Plenty of partnerships do survive the Saturn Return -- and ultimately achieve a deeper level of love and commitment. Honesty, flexibility and a willingness to release old habits and take a more mature approach are the keys to success. If you start a new relationship during your Saturn Return, expect your sweetie to ""play Saturn"" -- triggering your insecurities, and pushing you to step up and take greater responsibility for yourself. You will be tested to stay committed to your work and goals, even during the excitement of a new romance. Because the Saturn Return is a period that requires solitude and introspection, many people experience being single -- or temporarily separated from their partner -- during their Saturn Return. In some cases, it can feel like you have so much going on in your own life that you have no time or energy for a partnership. If you find yourself in this situation, commit to being your own best partner for the time being. Trust that the energy you invest in your individual growth and development will necessarily result in a more satisfying future partnership."
"The Saturn return takes about 27 to 29 years to circle your chart and lasts for two to three years—which explains why you feel like your entire life is about to change the second you blow out those candles on your 30th birthday. ""This is a time of maturity, when fun and games have to give way to a greater vision of yourself and life. When Saturn returns, it's all about slowing down to self-reflect. That helps you grow up and see life for what it is, not what you want it to be. Saturn is the truth—the bare truth—but it’s something you can count on. It won’t lie to you to make you feel better, but it will guide and help you learn your lesson if you’re willing to do the work. Maybe you're comfortable, but not exactly happy, in your relationship. Now's the time to be real with yourself—and your partner—so you can both start looking for something better. Saturn slows everything down because you need to see what has to be fixed. If you don’t pay attention, you’ll face a crisis. And that ""crisis"" can take any form—whatever is needed to make you see reality or where you need to improve. Saturn's mission is to point out what’s not working and why. Because your Saturn return only lasts two to three years, ask yourself what you want to accomplish in that time. Then, start making moves."
"Your first Saturn return occurs when you’re 29 and a half, but you’ll likely feel it for the year leading up to your 30th birthday. During your first Saturn return, you have a chance to dismantle those structures and start to build and shape new ones— ones that resonate with you and the life you want to create. It’s your astrological “coming of age.”  During your Saturn Return year, you take charge of your life. You start to let go of fear or worry about what your parents, friends, mentors, or family members think about you or your life. You feel more driven to accomplish something for yourself, whether that means traveling the world, buying a house, getting married or divorced, writing a book, having a child, or something else that requires a deep commitment.  Saturn lets you know what you’ve outgrown, and it invites you to let it go if necessary.  As you might imagine, letting go can be difficult, and you may face crisis points throughout your Saturn return year. If you do, rest assured, Saturn always usually offers rewards for good effort. Stay on path!  You could even have strange health issues come up unexpectedly and then subside after your thirtieth birthday. There are usually mind/body connections for these.  We all have limiting ideas or beliefs that transfer into fears. They can delay you from moving forward or taking action. They can make you feel stuck. It’s important to note, though, these are often perceived and not real. Once you face your fears and move through, you take a giant step forward toward actualizing your most expansive life possible."
"If you’re in your mid-to-late twenties or even in your early thirties, you are close to the heart of your first Saturn Return, and are probably feeling the crack of Saturn’s whip more than ever. If everything feels like chaos, if your relationships are breaking down and you’re questioning your career, your friendships, your sanity, and your very life, it is likely that it’s just the ripples of your Saturn Return descending. It’s vital that women especially look deeply at their father issues during this time because Saturn symbolizes the father (personally and universally), and can set us up with very particular responses to the men in our lives, as we attempt to fix whatever was broken in our relationship with our dads or dad like figures. As you hit the Saturn Return, you’re about to leap off the cliff of childhood and you feel estranged from external support systems. Now you can’t be taken care of; You have to learn to fend for yourself and figure out what truly constitutes the ground below. What internal resources do you draw upon for a safe landing if you are to make this leap, kicked out of the nest once and for all? Once you finish your Return, you’ll probably have a much better idea."
"Anyone who’s on the cusp of their 30s knows the feeling of dread that comes with knowing you’re leaving your carefree 20s behind. It’s the decade associated with more responsibility, so it’s no surprise people freak out before they hit the big 3-0. But there’s also an astrological basis for this mini-crisis: the Saturn return. An astrological event happens between the ages of 27-30, the Saturn return marks a period where you undergo a lot of changes, challenges and trials. For most people, the Saturn return is when they hit significant milestones, such as getting married, buying a house, or advancing in their careers. That’s because Saturn is the planet in astrology that is associated with maturity. Astrologers have different names for Saturn. He’s called the Great Teacher, for his role in teaching us important life lessons. But unlike Jupiter, who is more like a guru that imparts wisdom through spiritual teachings, Saturn is the “tough love” professor whose lessons are learned through hard work, patience and commitment. Saturn is the planet that governs time, commitment, rules, discipline and structure -- what most business people would call the ingredients to success. Saturnian energy can feel heavy and serious, but it’s also highly rewarding. Saturn says, it takes 10,000 hours to learn a new skill. But once you put in the work, you’ll be free to enjoy the rewards."
"Essentially, your Saturn return is a test. What is it testing? Maybe a better question is, what is is NOT testing?! Saturn is a hard taskmaster, & Saturn wants you to learn the difficult lessons so that you can move forward with your life. During your Saturn return, you will be asked repeatedly to prove that you have learned from the challenges you’ve faced over the last 29 years. Essentially, your Saturn return is a test. What is it testing? Maybe a better question is, what is is NOT testing?! Saturn is a hard taskmaster, & Saturn wants you to learn the difficult lessons so that you can move forward with your life. During your Saturn return, you will be asked repeatedly to prove that you have learned from the challenges you’ve faced over the last 29 years. Standing on the cusp of 30 years old can feel like staring into a huge cavern; it’s a natural time to do some self-assessment. Have we done the right thing? Are we in love with or married to someone who is going to love us, challenge us & support us no matter what? Do we have a job that brings meaning to our lives? Are we living to our fullest potential? These are all questions that Saturn demands we answer. During your Saturn return, it might feel like everything is thrown into turmoil, from your relationships to your career, even down to your family situation & where you live. I sometimes think of Saturn as a kind of loving bully — the cruel-to-be-kind type. He picks us up, turns us upside down & shakes everything out of our pockets. The stuff that stays is the stuff that is working. Everything else gets shaken loose."
"Since mastery is a key theme of the Saturn Return, you’re going to have to pay some dues if you want to reach the holy grail of expertise this cycle promises. If you’ve been coasting through bullshit jobs or pseudo-relationships, that could all change fast. It’s time to get invested, which might mean eating humble pie for breakfast, lunch and dinner as you learn the ropes. Keep your eye on your goal and don’t lose your determination! Saturn rewards discipline, and if you’re willing to put in that boots-on-the-ground gruntwork, you could find yourself vaulted into an esteemed position by the time the return is through. Relationships that are built on false premises can crumble during the Saturn Return. Even the happiest couples are bound to hit a rough patch as Saturn forces you to confront deeply engrained childhood patterns. Since Saturn is associated with the father, some “daddy lessons” could be served. Whether your pop was “Father of the Year” or totally absent, he set a template for relationships. During the Saturn Return, you can liberate yourself from that paradigm, and choose a partner who is right for you. (No matter what your family has to say about it.) Breakups aren’t essential; it’s just that Saturn prefers clear boundaries. Pull back from bae and remind yourself that autonomy is an aphrodisiac. Self-authorization over self-sacrifice, please! We realize this all sounds rather heavy. Certainly, there will be some “dark nights of the soul” during this three-year phase. The Saturn Return is basically boot camp. As the planetary personal trainer, Saturn breaks you down, blows the whistles on your bad habits and makes you do another set of reps until you’re fatigued. The goal is not to torture you. The ringed taskmaster wants to help you get in fighting shape, so you can go kick ass in the wild world of grown-ups."
"When Saturn is involved, think: responsibilities, rules, restrictions, obligations, challenges, and lessons. Sometimes tough ones. It’s like a cosmic check-in—and check-up—from the Lord of Karma himself. This is your astrological coming-of-age story. It is important to remember that Saturn’s job is to show you the areas of your life where you are the hardest on yourself. You are being pushed to level up to the next stage of life. After all, Saturn is the planetary taskmaster, and at this time, he will likely hold your feet to the proverbial fire. Consider your life before this moment: You have been restricted by the rules placed on you by your parents, teachers, bosses, mentors, and even society at large. It is a slow-moving process, so as you go through this, remember that there are no shortcuts, there will be tests, and you will get through it. By the end of your Saturn return (and by the time of your second and third Saturn return), as you continue to apply these hard-earned lessons, you will eventually greet Saturn like an old friend. You’ll see that Saturn’s tough love during your return called upon you to stop giving away your power. As a result, you’ll see that Saturn was not the author of your life. You are—and always were. Subsequently, Saturn didn’t take away anything that was meant for you. Saturn is here to confront you and ensure that you’re on the right path."
"At the first Saturn return, about the age of 29, you realize for the first time that it is already too late for some things. “Olympic gymnast” or “child prodigy”are roads that are firmly closed to you, if you haven’t already reached those destinations. The first Saturn return is a wake-up call that comes just as you’re entering your prime – when it’s still early enough in the game to change course, even if you do have to adjust some of your expectations. For the first time, you realize that there are mountains that might be a little bit too tall, too demanding, or too far away for you to conquer. There is pressure, at the first Saturn return, to put some points on the scoreboard. The pressure is strong to meet the external milestones we associate with maturity and success. Looking down the barrel of one’s 30th birthday, it can feel like we’re overdue … to marry, buy a house, make our first million, have a child. We realize in a very personal way that the clock is ticking, and though objectively we probably have much more life ahead of us than is behind us, it feels like mortality is gaining on us. Typically, we put the pedal to the metal at the first Saturn return, accelerating toward goals that are most often externalized and quantifiable. I came to astrological maturity just before my first Saturn return, as Saturn in Capricorn came into rendezvous with transiting Uranus and Neptune. I’d studied astrology a little since I was about twelve years old, and ever since I discovered Linda Goodman’s Sun Signs I had had the dream of being an astrologer – though I didn’t have any idea what that actually meant. But at the age of 28, I found a teacher and set out on my path. I believed I had found my calling. And by the time Saturn returned, I was giving readings, teaching classes, and planning my escape from the corporate world. Three days before my 30th birthday, I left my job. I had become an astrologer. I was still a long way from real success. I felt scared, financially insecure, a little bit lonely, and quite a bit in over my head. But in hindsight, I feel I really nailed that first Saturn return – because I stared my fears straight in the eye (my Saturn is in my second house; leaving a well-paying, secure government job for the uncertainty of self-employment was a true test of my grit) and claimed the place in the world that I felt was right for me."
"Transitioning into your 30s often represents a pivotal time in people’s lives and is only intensified by your Saturn Return. As it takes about three years for a Saturn transit through a Zodiac Sign, your Saturn Return is said to last the whole 3 years it is in that sign, usually being particularly powerful around the time it is exactly conjunct (aligned) with your Natal Saturn. You can expect to experience some deep transformations and a feeling of foundations literally crumbling at your feet as the world as you knew it, and your own perceptions of yourself, seemingly fall apart. This is good. It creates space for that which was not solidly built on lasting ground to be swept away and create space for your authentic self. You can really define your values in life during this time and put into perspective what does, or doesn’t, matter to you. Things that used to bring you joy or were a big part of your identity may no longer resonate. Your ideals may shift and your perceptions of what is a truly vibrant way of living may be completely redefined. Basically, you will be experiencing your astrological coming-of-age. This is a wonderfully fertile time for exploring the depths of your being and discovering what it is that gives you an honest and deep contentment. What lights you up from the inside out, how is your authentic self waiting to come out from the shadows and filter in through the cracks you are creating? Embrace it all. Learn and un-learn everything you previously thought you knew. Expand, contract, then expand again, and feel all the feels. Allow yourself plenty of time to experiment, play, rest, and come home back to yourself. Above all, be gentle and patient with yourself, people are more energetically sensitive than others and so you may be more affected. Or you may sail through completely easy breezy untouched, that’s fine too. Once you are out of your Saturn Return you should feel more at ease and in your body than ever before, a true reflective embodiment of your soul’s essence in its purity. You could find greater clarity, direction, purpose, and meaning in your life and journey. However, we are still always in constant flux and so the work of evolution is by no means over once you’ve completed your Saturn Return!"
"Saturn has a bit of a reputation. In astrology, the cosmic gas giant has historically been associated with death, misery, and even the Devil himself. Fortunately, we’ve more recently made peace with this powerful planet. In modern astrology, Saturn represents tradition and structure as symbolized by a paternal figure. But this figure is strict and values hard work and responsible choices. It adheres to a “tough love” approach, propelling us into life’s most difficult challenges so that we gain strength and wisdom. Saturn is definitely cruel to be kind. Before our Saturn return, we are a construction of outside influences: We are living the lives imposed on us by our parents, teachers, peers, and general society. When Saturn returns to its home base, the tough love planet reviews every aspect of our lives to ensure that we’re fulfilling our greatest personal potential. Generally speaking, this three-year period — which includes some intense moments as Saturn gets closer to its precise degree in your birth chart — is defined by the growing pains of radical transformation. Once our Saturn return is complete, we are finally free to live our best lives as we define them."
"Saturn returns and oppositions can be extremely powerful and turn your life in a completely new direction. Marriages, divorces, changes of residences, career or school changes, pregnancies and births are typical changes that occur with a major Saturn transit. They can be exciting or stressful, but in the end, they always move you to a new level of maturity, or serve to work through issues that have been brewing for quite some time. The seeds that were sewn during the past fourteen years are reaped during these transits. Of course, if your seeds are not sewn carefully, you will reap negative rather the positive results. If you have put negative, ineffective and unproductive energy into your life during the preceding fourteen years, your Saturn oppositions and returns will reflect this, and it will all come to fruition with a negative life-changing event during the next major Saturn transit. Whereas, positive energy and hard work result in Saturn returns and oppositions that are quite beneficial and simply move you into a new level of maturity. Putting positive energy and hard work into a worthwhile relationship can result in a satisfying marriage. Putting positive energy into a career can bring a promotion, more money, or a transfer to a new a town. Either way, Saturn's force brings things to a head, and for better or worse, leaves you dealing with the seeds you've sewn. Time is referred to as, unstoppable, irreversible, and also precious. Indeed, it is a powerful force. It never stops, and ultimately, it leads you to your death. It reveals all truths and teaches all lessons. On the most rudimentary level, it's all you really have. If you waste it, you waste your life. The ""Father Time"" figure is symbolic of this, and in astrology it is represented by Saturn and the sign of Capricorn."
"Because Saturn is one of the ""teacher planets in the sky,"" when it resets in our birth chart, it's a cosmic indication that it's time to learn a lesson. And because Saturn has attachments to karma, Powell said ""we learn [its] lessons through challenges, hardships, and responsibility."" While the thought of impending breakups, job losses, or crazy life moves can be pretty daunting, it's all for a good cause. ""Whatever challenges may arise are here to usher in your next phase of adulthood,"" Powell said. What's more, if you've already had a pretty rough go in your 20s (like maybe you struggled with social anxiety in college), your Saturn return might be a little easier on you. Based on how much ""Saturn action"" you have in your chart, it's possible you've learned the lessons you need to take on the heaviness that Saturn inevitably brings."
