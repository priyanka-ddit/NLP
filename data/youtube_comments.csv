Anyone here for Saturn return happening in 2020🤞🙃,8.0,173,1 year ago
"Honestly, at 28-31 if you dont feel the need to make a shift in your life there's something wrong. Your priorities CANNOT be the same at 20-30, your core values are more defined. Teens and 20's are turbulent times, you are going through a metamorphosis... it is painful because its evolution. Reality hits, and although you may not feel youthful, you realize at 30 you aren't ""Young"" anymore and the expectation is set for you to take over a rule the world for the next generation. I tried to explain this to an ex, that after a certain age, you do not have the same time when youre 32. Life has humbled you and in reality you DO NOT have the same energy and time to correct mistakes. This is the time to be a master, not an apprentice.  I am trying to rid myself of my childish ways before this time comes so I can embrace my God given authority gracefully. Also, its the time to strip the burdens of authority figures and BE one.",176.0,76,3 years ago

"I entered my Saturn return this year. I've been feeling strong urges to be my authentic self, to lose the fear that I won't be accepted or people won't take me seriously if I all of the sudden become who I truly feel I am. I've realized that I've been staying in my comfort zone when it comes to my artistic pursuits and that its not satisfying to water myself down that way. Its only the beginning of my Saturn return, but I'm definitely willing to put in the work necessary to align myself with my true authentic direction. Also thank you so much for these videos! I've been studying astrology for a couple years and its really been helpful and satisfying.",122.0,12,1 year ago (edited)
"When I turned 28 I felt that I have finally closed a chapter in my life and I even said that out loud! It just felt the universe was telling you're about to start a new chapter. I am an Sagittarius ascendant with the lovely*sarcasm* Saturn in my ascendant but the more I learn the more I'm appreciating Saturn being there. At 28 I quit my job, just walked out, and had this Devine faith that I was going to find something better sure enough I did! Well that's one example I can give from my experience",97.0,37,3 years ago

"This is definitely the most informative video about Saturn return. I'm going through that now. It's honesty very emotional and somewhat depressive. It's so true when you said you start thinking about death and end result at 28 (not in a suicidal way). Everything becomes so nostalgic during Saturn return. All the things you did during youth, all the lovers you've had become nostalgia and you realise so much have happened. You realize we're not gonna stay young forever and youth fades. Before the Saturn return, it felt like as if old people were different kind of creatures and we're some kind of privileged breed that aren't getting old. But Saturn return just wakes you up to reality. Just like how all the historical people died and how old people are dying, we're gonna die too. You only know it intellectually before Saturn return, but when Saturn return comes you just feel it so deeply within you. You know what I'm taking about if you had or having Saturn return. Even listening to old music you used to party before brings out Saturn energy that youth fades and life fades. In 100 years we're all gone and there are complete different kind of people/generations living on this earth. Saturn return is intense.",212.0,16,1 year ago (edited)

"Saturn is in my 3rd House, aquarius retrograde. So my comprehension is a little bit tense in this saturn return. It has always been tense, but for a year it is a lot more tense in the sense that if there s too much info coming into my sensing mechanism, my brain doesn t  know how to handle all of those info and prefers to personalize all of them. I think this might give an explanation to what ego breakdown is, because everything is somewhat relatable and when your mind tries to relate everything outside to your 'self',  ego starts to slowly die. As a saturn in aquarius, I am learning to be helpful for the community in the communicative and interactive areas of life. ☄️ And for a profession, as a Venus in the 10th House i always deeply knew what i wanted and needed. I Hope this profession of mine evolves towards the area that brings reputation. Because I need that in order to be helpful. My virgo stellium never gives up! ♍",175.0,0,1 month ago

"Kapiel, your life path is always so intriguing. Your talent in film is a great part of why your astrology videos are so alluring to view. Your talent in the technology is self evident. I'm immensely grateful for your agreement to engage in astrology teaching through film at this stage in this lifetime of yours. Your work has certainly made my life immeasurably richer.  Will you be doing a follow-up video on other types of Saturn return effects, like the one we experience in our late fifties? I'm also curious to understand how it affects those individual whose lives actually do end at that time. The 27 Club is a well known phenomenon among artists like Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Kurt Kobain, Amy Winehouse, etc.  My Sun is conjunct Saturn in my 11th with my moon & mercury (in my 10th) sandwiched neatly between my Mars (9th), my Ketu (10th), and my Saturn (11th). In other words, I spent a great deal of time unwinding the work of my Saturn return to really appreciate the strong, firm, but benevolent arm of Saturn now in my late thirties. I was narrowly close to joining the 27 Club myself, not because of any chemical addiction, but because of my sensitive nature and long past with severe depression. I feel much stronger now, but my father succumbed to the intensity of Saturn's return as he just passed away a few years after his 2nd transit.  I'd love to know your insights on this 27 Club phenomenon in relationship to Saturn and your insights on Saturn's additional returns later in life. Sent with much love and appreciation!

Saturn in my natal has a trine (major aspect) to my Moon so maybe that has to do with feeling some of these effects a bit early on. All I know is, it's like there's been a slight nudging towards this stuff since May of 2018 when I ditched this religious org I had been heavily a part of and devoted to for 2 years of my life. When I made the shift away from that I felt more at ease. Been a whirlwind though. Everytime I find myself tempted by something I was previously gungho about before May 2018, I get this moment where I absolutely almost hate it entirely and find no purpose in it.

I took Saturn Return in the most escapist possible way (out of complete ignorance as to what this return meant to one's life) and have been really struggling with professional/career identity issues for over ten years. Somehow there's been a change of thought recently (about a year ago) and it seems like I finally figured what it is I can be doing to fulfill my Dharma. Maybe there was a Saturn transit last year which promoted this change of heart and vision... I'm having to start over from scratch (again), but with a feeling of doing the right thing this time around.  Me being the child raised as ""the promise of the family"" and having to endure my own criticism and frustration and the perplexity of family members watching my decay, while having somewhat above average chances to succeed in life... Of course I tried to find answers through astrologers, tarot readers, oracles, but to no avail. With this video I FINALLY understood what happened to me back then, and most importantly, WHY I failed. I, for the first time in a decade, feel that I know what I have to do. Hopefully, Saturn will give me the strength needed to do it right this time.

"Ok, Saturn return is not meant to intimidate you it's meant to teach you that every action has an equal and opposite reaction, Science calls it The Universal Law of Cause and Effect, Religion calls it The Universal Law of Reaping and Sowing, but it's literally the same law, you get what you give. Saturn is the enforcer of bad actions Jupiter is the rewarder for good actions. Lots of people think (I used to too) that you can think or wish yourself into it, but the universe is a just universe and repays you for your actions in the material world not just thinking good towards others. If you want to be a millionaire you have to become a big giver, if you don't, you will continue to attract circumstances that leave you broke.  If you want love, find someone to love and never stop giving them love. I hope you learn this lesson it took me 7 long suffering years to learn this simply lesson. Jupiter is the givers planet, when we give Jupiter blesses us, when we don't Saturn curses us, harsh, but the truth.

"Thank you Ernst Wilhelm.  I found you following asking, 'Briefly, what is a Saturn return?', when someone kindly replied, it stimulated my response, which was, 'I'm aware that 28, in some signs, as with my own is the number of the magician. On reflection, I think one of the lessons I learnt during my first Saturn return is that we are ultimately responsible for the decisions we make, therefore, must consciously take charge of our own life in all aspects and be guided by our own inner calling, or, forever hold our peace (integral maturity); we are the makers and breakers of our own destiny. Excited, yet somewhat anxious in anticipation of my next Saturn return in 3 - 4 years from now. I think I will look deeper into what this all means and how it works; though I guess, like having a baby, one can never be prepared, but simply make way ?'

"I was watching this video because my Saturn return is exactly 1 year from now and I'm a little concerned about it since my Sade satti time (was in highschool thru college for me) was absolutely horrible. It completely derailed my life. On another level. I am still recovering in some ways from the damage of my Sade satti..and I see myself as a very Venusian person (and I have Saturn opposite my Venus, moon, mars) and so right now I have exact opposition of Saturn to my venus, next year in January is my Saturn return, then later in 2019 will be Saturn opposite moon, then Jan 2020, Saturn opposite mars. So its not just my Saturn return coming, its the full circle of that aspect in my natal chart coming back around.  I absolutely hate doing things I don't like.  I procrastinate to another level, however I do always get everything done- it's always just like on the latest possible day. So far ive lived a life that has made me suffer a lot, so I see it as not wanting to inflict any more suffering on myself so I let myself enjoy every second I have the opportunity to enjoy.  But the thing is, I want to develop that structure in my life and I know its needed for me to be successful. So while watching this video it really opened my mind to the truth that I cannot make excuses for myself. Okay, so I had hard times but I have to move forward and live within the same parameters as others. One of the things I absolutely hate is house cleaning. I put it all off to one day per week and it becomes like a whole day job. So hearing your words of wisdom, I started on my chores right away and realized I'd just found a way to make doing chores more enjoyable: listening to astrology/educational videos while doing tasks I hate!

Great video and outlook on the Saturn return. I'm 28 and I'm having my Saturn return this year and I looked further into my chart for this year and I saw that Saturn is going to come over my Saturn orb 3 times due to its retrograde phase. And Saturn was in retrograde when I was born so I was wondering if the first time it comes over the orb will be my Saturn return or will it be the second time it conjuncts its orb in retrograde since it was in retrograde at my birth? And then it conjuncts it again in November for the third time this year. Will all 3 of them be considered my Saturn return or just the first or second one? And I just learned what it means to have the moon conjunct Saturn in my birth chart which helps me understand the hard life I have been given. I'll be surprised if I make it out of this year alive or not homeless. I'm doing my best to stay positive but its really hard when you have only negative people around you and no friends to talk to.,195.0,0,5 years ago

"HI Ernst! Would you share your thoughts on the First Saturn Return in Scorpio (I'm not sure but I think it's the Second House, I was born on 14th of May 1984 in Europe). I had an accident on March and since then all the time I'm scared I may die. I'm preety scared actually. All the time appear scary things which make me think about death almost without break.  ...I feel scared, bad (mentally and physically, athough I did some examinations which all were ok, but even though I feel as if I were ill and were to die any moment), have no job (I had an accident at work and I don't work since then) etc. and have no possibility to see an Astrologist (run out of money). I have no doubts it's connected to Saturn Return.  I heard there are some points/moments which are important for Saturn's Transition. (Not sure but I think) I have 4 planets in Scorpio and I wanted to know what I should avoid/which dates are the worst and how to deal with this nightmare. For the last months I'm really trying my best but I'm extremelly stressed and worn out.  On the other hand there're many interesting events in my life which are manifesting one after another, like for example many meetings with the great masters (H.H. Dalai Lama etc.) or people I've always wanted to see in the past but I'd thought maybe I'll never do. For example somebody gives me a ticket to go and travel to see them or they just arrive to my country suddenly. I'm seeing them but can't feel joy, only I do that because I know this is what I should do, the feeling of fear is blocking almost all posibilities to enjoy even things which are as if made to be enjoyed.

In this state, nature always works in your favor-- synchronicity is very high-- life is not hard.

"#DianaQuestions This is only based on info found on the net and personal facts and life experience , and no I'm not trying to claim to be something special , if anything as a Christian it makes me look evil lol  . My names Julian , i was born on a Thursday ( Thorsday , Jupiter's day Joves day  Zeus's day etc , aka Amun Ra the Egyptian sun God )  29th February 1968 , i believe the same year the club of Rome was formed coincidently . As you say leap year comes from the Julian Calendar.  Julian apparantly means youthful and son of Jove lol . I was also born at house number 29 in Birmingham UK . I didn't know any of this until just before my 34 birthday nearly 6 years after the 28 year cycle that it takes for a leapyear to fall on the week day a leapyear was born on . I like to now consider that cycle my saturn birthday due to saturns 29.5  earth year long year  . My daughter who was purely out of coincidence given a name which means Pearl and Child of light  was born a few months after my 29th birthday conceived about 4 months after my 28th birthday , the 1st time a leapyear fell on a Thursday since I was born , and i got with her mother when i was still 27 2 weeks before my 28th birthday.  Apparantly saturn spends around around 2 and a half years in each star sign from 27 to 29 and a half years and was in aries  when she  was born and when i was born and she was born in april which makes her an aries and her son too lol . Weird or what . Its actually quite scary for me as im a christian , not a very good one but an honest and compassionate one and a pretty tough one too actually but only because ive had to defend myself from bullies over 60 times who think because im so gentle natured and softly spoken they think I'm weak lol , foolish people,  I never lost a one on one fight not even once . Julius Ceasar was the high Preist to Jupiter before he became the famous leader he was and also the man who set up the Julian Calendar based on knowledge he was given by Sosoginese of Alexandria,  Cleo Patras astronomer,  the sun worshippers.  366 days in a leapyear 366/666 3×6 . 66days and 6 hours between Christmas day and a leapyear After splitting with my ex my daughter and I lived at number 63 6x3 lol , when my friends and I steamed the old wallpaper off of her bedroom walls to decorate her room for her there was a drawing of the devil's face with horns etc on the wall underneath . I painted over it but too late she saw it and wouldn't sleep in that room again and I don't blame her . I haventbeven begun to tell you about the weird things in my life that have happehed , many if not most of which happened before i even discovered any of this knowledge about myself . But heres just one that happened a couple of years before i found these things out . When i split eith my ex she got eith an 18 year old lad , she was 27 i was 31 . He was a hard cors heroin addict injecting and passing out around my daghter and stepdaughter which is how my daughter came to oive with me for 13 months.  One night whilst driving back to my flat number 63 Kendrick house in west Bromwich i was stopped for not having my seatbelt on , my daughter did though . I was annoyed at being fined as i was struggling financially after having to stop being a long distance truck driver in order to keep my daughter safe from the danger of a heroin addict being around her . I said why don't you catch real criminals like the lad who was robbing schools and churches and cars etc for his habit and living with my ex after splitting up my daughters parents they asked who and they confirmed they knew him , i regretfully said I wish he'd just drop dead . Well about a month or so later he was robbing a local church and died in a freak accident resulting in a screwdriver piercing his eye and going into his brain . I became a Christian within the next few years . I can't tell you how many times I've witnessed karma exacting what would seem like revenge on people who have crossed me . https://youtu.be/G3i6UwVkP6M https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Church+raider+died+after+screwdriver+speared+him+through+eye.-a073570616",800.0,1,2 years ago (edited)

"Hi KRS, I just found out about your reading while desperately looking for an Expert Astrologer by someone who totally believes your reading. Your reading is friendly and helpful to understand, so thank you!!  Well, I am Scorpion by Vadic Astro and Saggie by Western. The personality you have described on Scorpion was not quite right to me, in fact I even laughed for some many completely opposite personalities you have mentioned but when I watched your Saggie reading and you are spot on in most areas. However, a few of the transformation on Scorpion can be right. I have noticed a huge changed into my personality when I got seriously ill some 20 years ago. My personality in Saggie is what I believe is correct almost but when it comes to Karmic life, I am not sure which one to believe. last 3 years have been absolutely painful in every aspects for me which according to Scorpion is correct but then being a Saggie in western belief, there are so many things matches as well. Therefore, would you be able to suggest to belief in only one. I am just so so so confused. I really thought my hard time meant to pass by 2015 if I am to belief in Scorpion but it seems there is still a long way to go. Just wonder when this is ganna end...",231.0,0,6 years ago

I have Saturn in Sagittarius within the 6th house.  Jupiter is in the eight house.  I have been becoming spiritual for the passed year.  I just turned thirty one about a week and a half ago.  I assume that because Jupiter is expanding my knowledge of my eight house in Aquarius (soul ruler) that maybe I am understanding metaphysical topics earlier in life.

"Everyone's Saturn is modified because everybody in the world has either conjunctions and/or aspects in different houses as well as in different degrees in which you have to look at the nakshatra which alters the traits of Saturn in signs and houses.

What that means is that if no other planets were in your chart this is how Saturn, or Mars, or Jupiter etc. would behave in this sign without knowing anything else.",88.0,1,7 years ago

So I for awhile made it my goal to rebel against ""religion"" and hated it but now I believe in the Pagan Gods and am more calm. I just quietly do my own thing. I do tend to focus on Sagittarius themes way too much though in a way too serious and possibly narrow minded way.   I think Uranus in this case is a little stronger due to how its themes play out more in my life.   My Girlfriend is Aquarius rising Saturn in Capricorn conjunct Uranus in Capricorn.

"Sad to hear Kapiel. I have moon in Leo (Magha). My father had heart attack when I was wicked, egoistic and ignorant guy back in 2007 unaware that I was going through Saade Saati's end of middle phase who was on long trip enjoying with friends. He recovered after being in ICU for many months. Apart from this toughest lesson, there were some more like my mother had stomach related surgery, my job offer was revoked due to recession. Did not get support of any people due to my lack of maintaining good relationships. Saturn made me go on my knees and made me extremely humble, rational and a man from a boy. It put me on a different path in which I came out glowing bright and as strong as a diamond.",133.0,34,1 year ago (edited)

Saturn is planet of justice and gives one results on the basis of their karmas, if your work hard and have discipline and do good deeds then Sade sati will give one amazing fruits, thats why narendra modi became prime minister during his Sade sati, irrespective of how well your moon is placed.

My first 5 year of sade sati was terrible. I lost my confidence. Nothing helps. All remedies can only give hope. I am a taurus ascendant with Sagittarius moon. I also study astrology. Before sade sati i knew the problems are coming but when the time came i lost myself. Still i am recovering. I faced severe issues related to 7th, 8th house. Ashtakwarga points really matter alot.  I had 4 accidents during first 5 year of sade sati. Relationship got spoiled. Only My X pillow knows my pain. And still i am running through sade sati and no body understand what I suffered and why i changed. Soon i am going to enter rahu mahadasha(6th house sitting with Jupiter).

"“What hurts us initially makes us stronger in the end; and what gives us pleasure initially makes us most of the times suffer in the end.”   For those of you who will be soon experiencing Sade-Sati:   It is undoubtedly going to be a tough/life-transforming ride in most cases.   There will many life- teaching experiences that will help you figure out who are the ones that value the REAL you, and not the SUCCESSFUL you/the you that the world has always been happy to be with before this phase. (Please be careful/extra cautious when trusting people during this phase.)   You will be put into situations where you will have to put in your 100% just to get an output that will never even be closely reflective of what you truly deserve/expected when working. There will be a lot of DELAY when it comes to getting what you want. You are not denied in most cases the result, but you are going to get it after a lot of delay.   This phase will make you question your purpose in life. It will keep throwing questions and constantly asking you to check if your actions are in alignment with your true intentions when it comes to relationships, work, and other areas of life. It will give you a lot of ALONE time even if you like it or don’t.   Most importantly, there will be times you will not really understand how to even express what you feel on the inside. At times, you might even feel like there is some weight on your head that you are carrying. You will feel that the support sources that have always been there to give you that emotional/financial support are not anymore doing the same/even if they try to do, something or the other isn’t happening that is stopping you from receiving that support/love/warmth.   Trust me, if you can learn to be patient and try to deal with it having this, Growth Mindset, it will help you re-discover yourself. It will help you tap the potential side of you/the warrior side in you were never really aware of.   Most importantly it will teach you that you are alone, and you have to fight for what you want in life all by yourself. What it tries to do is it tries to teach you to go forward with adapting ways that will allow you to draw strength from the inside (as earlier all along most of us have been trying to draw this strength from the outside of us).  I have tears as I am typing this comment. That was the kind of painful phase I’ve been going through. But, I am sure I will and all of you who are going through, and who will be going through will come out with flying colors in the end learning lessons that will make you great mentors and teachers for everyone associated with you in your life.   At the end, learning is growing, and there is no better teacher than Shani Dev Himself.   Good Luck.

"Brilliant effort Punneit. An interesting perspective  on Shani's path of 7.5yrs and its 3,7,10 aspects from each of the three house transits. Pure logic lends a lot of clarity on the possible outcomes of the much dreaded period. Yes, every person will experience the impact differently as a lot depends on the strength of the ""Manas"" (moon), it's Nakshatra placement and  Mahadasa in play. However this video brings you as close as possible to the real journey. I have experienced two sadde sattis over the last five decades and can most certainly vouch on the unnerving and life changing resultant effects of such a transit.

My Sadi Sati will start in yr 2020 and it will the third phase of Sadi Sati. Luckily, I'm not old & frail yet....should be able to withstand mentally & physically, the very tough period. 🙄😬😃.

"At the peak of my sadesati when Saturn was exactly over my moon, he actually taught me to overcome fear and sense of lacking capacity. I dont think its right to say Saturn causes fear, he removes the comfort factors, the crutches and that causes fear. But ultimately the harsh directness makes one strong and grow. One wouldnt willingly go to tough situations unless one is an evolved soul like Kunti :)",72.0,0,8 months ago

"Scorpio Moon, ending Sade Sati in Jan 2020. Since November 2011 my life changed completely... I became so much aware, too much careful, too much thoughts in my head, I struggle enjoying life, I learned so much, Sade sati started make me imagine in other people situations and how'd I feel if something would happen to me, I started researching like crazy, I can easily understand if someone is lying or not, I know who to trust thats because I realized that eyes really are soul mirrors and reflect quality of intentions you hide, everything happens for a reason, everything is never random there's a reason behind it, our bodies are the reflection of ourselves, I became detached first but now I just prefer to be alone or with few people. I had acne, now im left with acne scars, got even slimmer than I already was, but overally my body is very very harmonic, example, my shoulders got very broad while before they were the opposite (I was 15 when started sade sati, now Im about 23). I stopped eating animals and whatever comes from animal cruelty because I saw and felt the animals pain in the slaughterhouses...I choose ethics and justice over taste, I can see through bullshits, I overanalyze things, more decisive, I have more faith in myself, I see things in a different perspective, more clearly. If this had to happen to get better I accept that even if in this 7+ years period I cried so much, felt guilty for my irresponsible behaviours or for what I could have done better... Hope things get better, BTW from the beginning of Sade Sati is like Im so much different person. Oh, and I worry so much and understand how lives are precious. I literally can't live the present moment.",303.0,1,1 year ago (edited)

"I will be having second sade sati from Jan 2020 in my Shani mahadasha of last exact seven and half remaining years.  Great information punneit . I believe if we are doing our karma without any expectations there is nothing to fear. Life really is all about experiences and Shani Maharaj teaches us through Being rather than Doing something or someone..All the best for people who are going through this phase. I have a question though, if a planet is under vedha ( obstruction) will it be giving its prescribed results, even if it is Saturn transition during Shani mahadasha and sade sati. Last time I had my extraordinary period in life because I was a student and not much suffering, but Saturn was in vedh for long duration of time, and I was running Guru mahadasha.",137.0,3,1 year ago (edited)

"Truly excellent video, a wonderful and detailed analysis.   I'm a Purvashada (Sagittarius) moon with my Lagna also in the same nakshatra... Right in the heaviest crunch of my first round Sade Sati right now as Saturn is obviously conjoined with Ketu, and they are retrograding back toward my moon's exact degrees! The pressure is extra strong here with natal retro-Saturn AK.   Many things have fallen through after innumerable setbacks and boundaries, leaving only the realistic way forward to tread on - and every unnecessary relationship I'd been attached to has been 'filtered out'. Unforeseen health issues have forced attention and care... Essentially every area is being thoroughly nitpicked and stripped back!   Have found myself at that point where this cold isolation is really showing things how they really are and forcing a realistic look at important hidden areas issues out of the attic - time for some thorough dusting and rebuilding of foundations henceforth! The ultimate refurbishment!   It's a super crushing process but undoubtedly necessary in the end. Thanks for the clarity and sense of hope your video has surely given. Agreed that this is the very best YouTube video on the topic!  Would also recommend viewers to check out Barbra Pijan's webpage writeup on Sade Sati - the written equivalent of your video.",214.0,0,1 year ago (edited)

This period seems as if you are watching some hindi movie where anything weird can happen. Post 50 years of age this is teaching me so much.

If I do what I should have done long time back, I would be shaking up my entire life. At the same time I feel that I have to devote my energies towards finding myself peace within.

"This is the best explanations of ""Sade Sati"" by any astrologer . Every part said correctly. 200% correct guidelines. I go through all three phase of Sade sati. My all phase was exactly the same what you are saying. I have libra moon sing. Feel the most strong power of Saturn.  In my case :-  1st phase - At the end of this phase I left my job. Then 2nd phase start.  2nd phase - When Saturn place with same degree with moon. I was completely lost my self because within few month I loses everything my Byk, house all. No food or one time food in a day for few month. There was a day when I wasn't have 10 rupees in my pocket. At the end of this phase I start to do temporary work here or there it's may be 15 day in a month. Here is the magic start of Saturn. Then start the 3rd phase.  3rd phase - At the very beginning Saturn give me a job. What I was very desperately trying in 2nd phase. Which is much better then what I left in 1st phase. Initially job was very normal. But as the day progress it's getting better and better.  Here is a few thing:- Saturn may take everything from me for few month. But What he return it's many & more.   Everyone required A bad ""Sade sati "" in there life. Because it's change completely a person in a good way.  Bease after that 7.5 years it's a different person all together. From honesty, Approch, Dignity, Capability,Thinking, Application, work procedures, Calculation, respect for all people & many more.  Unless or until any invisible force drive you. You will not doing anything wrong after this experience. Saturn will always knock your inner mind. So you always alert. Thank You ""Saturn"". Thank You "" This Channel"". Thanks Punneit Sir. Luv u.... Sir , I have one request to you  Please Share your ""Saturn"" Mahadasha analysis. And mention when Saturn placed in 3rd,6th & 12th house of natal chart.  Thank you all.🤗🤗🤗👏👏👏",347.0,3,1 year ago
"Nice explanation. At 14:14 i think your statement is misleading ""We don't want to quit the material world"". Please check, quit material world means sanyas :). Wouldn't it be more appropriate would be to say ""Adapt a more spiritual way of life living in this material world during the period to evolve as a better human being. I am saying this based on my experience."". Secondly regarding remedies in my experience(when on mind), if spiritual remedies are taken so they become a habit like feeding the poor people, serving nature in any form, doing charity, meditation, helping others etc(kind of karma yoga practice), it releases the pressure because that is what the change in the mind a good teacher is looking for.",122.0,0,1 year ago (edited)

"What a  serendipidity dear Punneit,, as an amateur western astrology scholar, I've been researching this crucial aspect while experimenting on my natal chart for the last final days! Having my natal Moon in Aquarius, I've experienced my first Shani Sadhe Sati phase in Capricorn in 1990-1998 (rising-peak-setting), the second one will kick off next, February 2020, if I'm not mistaken. You're truly an amazing astrologer, long-time follower. The effects contradictory yes, because Shani Sadhe Sati provides both lots of opportunities, new heights but also many hindrances, obstacles in one's life. I did rejected the call of Shani in the second phase, not surrendered, hence Shani crushed my dreams...all the big troubles, eventually in the third final phase I've learned my lessons! Thank you very much for this amazing, well-articulated analysis. I do hope to get a personal yearly analysis for 2020 in autumn, if you'll have time and will.

"Shani is the lord of justice and gives fruits of your deeds , let me tell you, karma means not only the actions you perform but the intentions within and the concealing hidden intention behind the action , saade sati is a period where all the deeds of your past are being answered to you by putting you in the position of all suffered and happy people in your connection , example you have caused misery  to someone and they suffered ,now in saade sati you would live their life somehow in the pattern of your life and that past karma would only end of you realise that mistake and atone not to repeat it ,I mean you have resolved very strongly to change .  Other part is if you have done very good deeds unselfishly you would be too rewarded with unselfish favour by others . Now I'll tell you how saade sati helps your future , the lessons you take in these 7.5 years must be a take away for life ,do not repeat the same ,you are a transformed person because of self realisation , the travel that the speaker in the video, actually has a deeper meaning ,travel here is a deep feeling of lost mind ,slow and dull blind walk in life , seperation from others and all your comforts ,this happens not to cause you mysery but to build your individual capacity for something that's coming in the future to take up ,once you have deeply looked within and understood what you really want and that which is unnecessary ,you will on your own work very hard for it and later be rewarded for life on that which you have dedicated all your energy , in the mid of saade sati you will be tested every now and then on how fixated you are on your karma ,if you deviate Shani will remind you again by repeating the cycle ,because we are humans and its our natural tendancy to deviate so don't worry he is training you the hard way of life so you as individuals become self sufficient and walk life with wisdom not pride and blind , one more amazing facts are saade sati opens your eye towards different individuals ,helps you to truly value and respect those who dedicate their lives for your uplift ,and saade sati will reveal your foes too and help you to filter your community of bonds to a hand full of true souls , guys trust me don't fear  Lord Shani ,in deed feel protected from the plays of life ,Shani is here to hold your hand and teach you to walk on all rough platforms of life in these 7.5 years so you can walk the rest of life on your own individual ability and not mislead by anyone .....,OM NAMAH SHIVAYA 🙏",478.0,1,1 year ago

Interesting looking at AL from the ascendant the moon was transiting my tenth where Saturn is in the birth chart when my mother died. Saturn transit was the seventh from that in Libra she is a Libra. The tenth is Aries and I am in a Mars dasa. When I drill down into the sub dasa period it corresponds to the planets that where in these places.  ,67.0,0,7 years ago

I think the K.N. Rao calculation of Arudha Lagna is correct because I know somebody who has Ascendent Lord in the 7th. And has moon in the 4th which traditionally becomes the Arudha Lagna.

So when in 12 he directly aspects the natal moon thereby creating the most trouble. At least that is my personal experience.,92.0,0,4 years ago

I gained so much that today I'm on my way to be an Entrepreneur. How successful I'm going to be is a different story, But I gained good knowledge during that Period. I met my spouse during the 1st phase of the period. I invested in property and Build an asset for me. Got married in 2nd phase of Period. Got stable financially. I became believer of Astrology and cosmic powers in this period. Became strong believer of Destiny & Prophecy. Got good opportunities from MNC's. Negative (started from 2nd Phase). My Personal relation went through tsunami. Got Divorced. Legal cases (all on personal relation front). I was earning good but at the same time all my earnings and savings drained out in personal issues. I got respect on career front, but got humiliated on personal front.

Yes, during my peak sade sati period,  I had couple of tough incidents but they were not so difficult to deal with and I had life transforming experiences both inner and outer (career) in those years. I didn't know that I was going through sade sati during that time but I consider those years to be my most productive years of my life.",91.0,4,3 years ago

"For the wrong decision part : I was forewarned about the outcome of my marriage, I saw the signs that things are not that what it seemed to me during 3.5 years of relation. Just before marriage I came to know about the mental disorder. But when I was asked if I really want to go ahead with the marriage, My Logical mind was saying NO, and my heart said How can I say NO, what if It happened to me, would she take the same decision. I was non-believer till this time so I thought I can change things. I took the decision and Things didn't work. I came in touch with person and my whole life was predicted which changed me completely. I was thinking DARN!!!.. holy GOD.. what is this.. is this some kind of matrix and am I really trapped inside. What I was thinking if everything is pre-destined. Can I really change anything. When people started questioning me that you are so good in analysis, in understanding people, how couldn't you see this coming, how could you take that decision. I came up with my own theory just to convince myself and not to go insane. If it is already predicted about the 2nd marriage, something has to happen to make the 1st one break. So I took the decision as per my destiny which I thought I am changing my destiny. In actual my mind was playing tricks to take decision as per my destiny. It all happened during this 7.5 years cycle. ",259.0,0,7 years ago

"People who don't understand the charts and find it difficult to interpret , Shani is the lord of justice and gives fruits of your deeds , let me tell you, karma means not only the actions you perform but the intentions within and the concealing hidden intention behind the action , saade sati is a period where all the deeds of your past are being answered to you by putting you in the position of all suffered and happy people in your connection , example you have caused misery  to someone and they suffered ,now in saade sati you would live their life somehow in the pattern of your life and that past karma would only end of you realise that mistake and atone not to repeat it ,I mean you have resolved very strongly to change .  Other part is if you have done very good deeds unselfishly you would be too rewarded with unselfish favour by others . Now I'll tell you how saade sati helps your future , the lessons you take in these 7.5 years must be a take away for life ,do not repeat the same ,you are a transformed person because of self realisation , the travel that the speaker in the video, actually has a deeper meaning ,travel here is a deep feeling of lost mind ,slow and dull blind walk in life , seperation from others and all your comforts ,this happens not to cause you mysery but to build your individual capacity for something that's coming in the future to take up ,once you have deeply looked within and understood what you really want and that which is unnecessary ,you will on your own work very hard for it and later be rewarded for life on that which you have dedicated all your energy , in the mid of saade sati you will be tested every now and then on how fixated you are on your karma ,if you deviate Shani will remind you again by repeating the cycle ,because we are humans and its our natural tendancy to deviate so don't worry he is training you the hard way of life so you as individuals become self sufficient and walk life with wisdom not pride and blind , one more amazing facts are saade sati opens your eye towards different individuals ,helps you to truly value and respect those who dedicate their lives for your uplift ,and saade sati will reveal your foes too and help you to filter your community of bonds to a hand full of true souls , guys trust me don't fear  Lord Shani ,in deed feel protected from the plays of life ,Shani is here to hold your hand and teach you to walk on all rough platforms of life in these 7.5 years so you can walk the rest of life on your own individual ability and not mislead by anyone .....,OM NAMAH SHIVAYA 🙏",491.0,34,1 year ago (edited)

"Suniji thanks for sharing this video. This time around, though, the Unknown astrologer was shooting concepts down without much explanation. He did present 3 charts to explain why BAV does not work for Transits, but only looked at the Numeric values. AV output is in numbers but the concept is based on the Karakas. If a particular planet say Saturn has 3 points for a house then it means that there are 3 planets contributing to that house. These are the planets which will help the native when Saturn transits that house. These planets in real life are the persons or relations in his life who will help him. Say if Mars is one of them, then Mars could be say DK and from natural karakatattva is Bhratru. Considering the person is unmarried then Mars in the form of his brothers, colleagues, batchmates etc will come forward and help the person. But if Mars is weak then even if it wants to its unable to help the person out. Similarly we have to understand of other planets too. Hence more the points means there are more people or relations in the persons life who will help the person, and lesser points mean lesser people. So when there are lesser people then the reliance on a strong planet becomes imperative to succeed. But if most planets contributing points are not strong then even if there are 4 or more still they wont help. SAV is relative to overall chart and all the planets hence for specific planet transits look specifically at the BAV of that planet. Hope this helps.",268.0,0,2 years ago

"Good video with new insights into Sade Sati!  However, sade sati and related transits alone do not explain most of the differences. The second horoscope (of the rowdy) has some bad combinations to begin with.  His 5th lord Saturn is with enemy and 12th lord Sun limiting poorva punya. His 11th lord Moon is malefic (waning moon) and is in 12th house of losses with no good aspects. Worst of all his Jupiter is badly afflicted with Rahu in all important 7th house of friends/partners with Guru-Chandala yoga and Jupiter is in gandanta. No wonder he was enjoys the company of miscreants and being rude to elders, teachers and others. His basic foundation is quite weak, he needed significant help to make a basic living. Either military (sainik) or strict boarding schools or vocational training schools would have been better for him.  On the other hand the first horoscope (of the engineer), moon is beneficial (waxing moon) and has good aspect of Jupiter and Jupiter is quite strong, as lagna lord  he aspects lagna giving strong protection lifelong. His 8th house has planets indicating capacity for hardwork. Finally 3rd lord Saturn in 12th house could give vipareeta Rajayoga according to some. All in all, his foundation is very strong, and of course his hardwork during Saturn transits helped him to succeed in life.   I fully agree that sade sati and other transits can be great if you work hard and focus on good deeds but the amount of hardwork needed depends on the native chart itself. These videos are great! Please keep up the good work!",266.0,4,2 years ago (edited)

"Dear UA & SA ji..you said that saturn should act more harshly when compared to 2-3 charts.But i disagree with you.To be frank the 1st chart has so many plus placements of saturn from his own houses.It means, saturn placed in 11th from his own house capricorn and in 10th from Aquarius ,both are good position in giving good results in Sade sati pereoid. Being 2nd and 3rd lord,saturn becomes a neutral planet for sagittarius lagna and he cant be harsh in his sadesati. This is the actual reason why his Sade time was good in nature.  In the 2nd chart.see the saturn placements from his own houses.Yes saturn is friend for virgo lagna but his posited in 12th from the 5th[capricorn]and in 11th from the 6th[Aquarius].His poorva punya  completely exhausted in sadesati & hence he experienced what you briefed in the video.Being  placed in 11th from the 6th of trauma and accidents,he recovered from that violent incident .Even though saturn is a friend of virgo,his placements in the chart from his own houses made sadesati worse.It is not the question of friend  or Foe to lagna not counted for sadesati negitive and positive effects.All depends, when saturn placed in good house from his two houses called capricorn-Aquarius.   In 3rd chart-saturn placed in 9th from his 3rd house capricorn[events and communications].so he started a event management company.From the 4th house of office or organaisation[Aquarius],he is in 8th house of sudden losses.4th house is also subordinates.so his subordinates under loss . i strongly felt that  key logic behind sadesati was missed in this video.

"Dear Mr. Sunil John,  I have been following your channel for some time and would like to tell you how much I look forward to the new uploads. I must congratulate you on this commendable job of finding rare gems from vast ocean of Jyotish.   I particularly enjoyed Dr.Suresh Chandra Miahra’s interview. It was one of your best series. Well made and in-depth. The lady who conducted the talk was erudite and Dr.Mishra, of course had resplendent knowledge to share.     There were other remarkable sessions like K.N.Rao, Naleen Desai, Smt Gayatri Vasudev, Sunil kaushik, Dr.Manish Pandit.        It would be great if you bring out more “talks” on  Spirituality. India has so many liniages like nathsampraday, Avadhoot, Kashmiri shaivism, tantrashstra, hathyoga to name a few. These all are intertwined with each other and with Jyotish too. You have established monumental platform here and if you involve other esoteric keynotes that definitely would be singular.   Awaiting many more stellar video’s.  Best wishes and regards",162.0,0,2 years ago

"From the bottom of my heart, I like to thank both you and Unknown Astrologer for sharing this knowledge of Sadesati. I agree 200% with what Unknown Astrologer has shared in the video. I can correlate all of this to my life events now, for all that happened before and during the Sadesati period. While growing up, I always wanted to go to US and permanently settle there. I came to US in Apr-2005 and with so many life and world events happening in between, I finally got my GC in Aug-2013. With the US recession happening, tightening of US visas and what not, it was mentally stressful time but i can say now I made through it. I think my Sadesati was running from 2006 to 2014 ( I am Saggitarius Lagna and i can share my birth details in email if you like to check).  Now after hearing your talk and looking back at life, I can understand better the importance of doing good Karma even it is tough on oneself. I cannot claim that I have done all good karma before the last sadesati period but I tried my best. I believe we always remember our good karma but we forget our bad karma till the reality of Saturn and Sadesati hits us on our head. Everything said in the video makes all the sense now.   Also, I understand the importance of having focused goal and continously working towards it even if at day, week or month level, it seems that we are not getting close to it or it will not fructify. From this video, I now understand that if  we are focused on our goal, keep talking actions towards it and never ever give up, then Sadesati or Saturn or God will give the results to us at the right time.  I have seen many Saptarishi videos over years and these videos have a deepest level of truth and satvik teachings or life lessons in them. I believe that these videos teach us more on life and improving our karma than what many sadhus of today teach us. Thank you and your team for making these videos. Keep up the excellent work in bringing forward these hidden gems in astrology (and life lessons) to all of us.  Best Regards.",384.0,2,2 years ago
"One thing I want to make clear ..It was my personal research .. pardon me if I am wrong, Firstly sadesati is not in books or in any scriptures if consider sadesati and the 4,6,8 from moon all these it would give you total of 15 years ..for 120 dasha system it would give you 60years which is half...so What I believe is when ever there is saturn dasha and antardasha ..Irrespective of the position or the bala or anything he will give karma effects to 4 houses..No matter how Good it could be ,saturn find no relationship when giving an output. he will made justice.. he gives you a chance..if you still continue to do that.. No matter what he would put you in the same trouble.. and Saturn went against all the odds to save his mother .. and for him mother is the biggest person in the universe.and if you disrespect your mother ,disrespect women think about the things u done.. I leave it to your imaginations..That's what shani for you..he is the justice ,he does the work..he saves you if you been good and tries to help you and if you aren't good it would do the karma..",202.0,0,8 months ago

Shani in my natal chart is in 3rd house, and I'm a Virgo lagna. In my  Navamsa, it is in 5th house in Capricorn. Saturn rules both houses. So does it mean Saturn is constantly going to watch over my health, debts, daily work, enemies etc? Will it destroy that house or amplify it? Of late, i have been facing terrible health issues and i realize i cannot ignore them any longer as I've done in the past. Makes me think my navamsa chart is in full play here? So in this context..Should I consider the natal chart placement or the navamsa placement (I'm married, what I read is married people should focus more on navamsa chart)?

My husband is going through Sade sati currently because he is dhanu rashi. His Saturn is in 12th house. Both of us have rahu in 7th house. Ever since his Sade sati started I have been suffering very badly in my job and accidents. Eye vision loss, foot fracture, 2 jobs lost for me. My Dasha is shukra and I've had a wonderful life full of success. So nothing changed for me.

But my saade saati is bad ... even the life before saade sati was not great... never achieved in life what i really wanted from school rank to admission in college of my choice to clearing important exams to landing job at my desired place and marrying person of my choice... had a very difficult childhood too... and all this despite having Saturn in 10th house of Aquarius for taurus ascendant...

Ashtak varga is best used in the context of today's transit. See how planets are having relationship today. Then co-relate it with natal grahas and 10th house from their natal placements.

If Saturn is contributing 4 points during transit even though it is 0 in BAV of Saturn the results would be good.,67.0,0,2 years ago (edited)

I respect each and every teacher i dont want deny anyone but after looking at the 1st chart was very powerful then 2nd one because jupiters 5th aspect was on moon in the 9th house which gives moon powers and is blessings of god on native its a nav pancham yoga and the second chart was the worst one because moon is posited in the 12th house lord of the 12th house is sun conjuct with  saturn in the house of jupiter which is conjunct with rahu in the seventh now calculate in mind accident spot jupiter and rahu aspect are on lagna dashas has to play role here he may be  in md or ad of mars or jupiter its my judgement only the thing i want to clear instead of looking saturn one should see the position of moon aspect on moon how much strong is ones moon mind to bear saturns sadesati.

"I totally agree Komilla. When I was in my last Sadesati I wanted to separate from my husband, because he was abroad and I felt abandoned, I was young, stupid, annoyed - and wanted to be a nun, or marry someone else. 😱😂 But luckily, because I knew Jyotish, I also knew that people make bad decisions in Sade Sati - so I told myself 'if this marriage REALLY is not good for me, it will be so after the Sade Sati too. So let me wait for the next 1.5 years and then decide.'  I had to fight with myself, but after Sade Sati was over, suddenly I was able to join my husband and I am SO GLAD I waited. My husband is the treasure of my life. I can't imagine the harm I would have done myself if I had not waited.  Of course during the Sade Sati I did a lot of spiritual remedies & lived simply.  I also lost my mother, and my brother during that time. There is no loss WORSE than losing the mother. 31 years later still I note her loss in my life. So the debts had to be paid in Sade Sati, but I saved the third wilful loss.",209.0,31,1 year ago (edited)

Made a very bad decision to sold my car. But first year of SS was good in carrer and money income! Some people warned me about my issues,but I guess I was blind and stubborn. Now they tell me there was also black magic involved.Had to paid my karma I guess. But with more discipline and not panicking, going by the flow of oportunities I colud do better decisions! So don't be scared of SS.Universe/life is always with you and at the very dark dark place,when you thimk he left you He (the universe) offers you a solution-just don't overlook it.

"I am fortunately to have some general idea in vedic astrology since 2012, I had made conscious cautious decision even before my sade sati. My natal Capricorn moon in 6th Leo ascendant natal Saturn in Libra with Sun in 3rd, when transit Saturn in 4th I ended the difficult relationship with my mother, and when Saturn transit in 5th 12th from natal moon I bought a second (bigger) property moved home as I forced to move home due to long time difficult neighbor but also got my driving license and finally received my custom made first car, took a while to renovate the new home it was difficult also but very happy in the new home, eventually successfully sold the old property to reduce financial debt, also recently paid off the kitchen loan. I also reviewed my spending habit and made some positive change. Some minor health issue, but also gradually improved with change of eating habit, discipline and patience. Currently the manager at work is real dictator who broke many workplace regulations, natal Sun Saturn 10th from Moon... I had asked union to help awaiting for the result so far I seem to have support from several departments externally and internally. I will soon resume my regular blood donation once physically ready.",213.0,2,1 year ago

If I could put in the next opportunities in the review of the video, some text or support material on the subject would be of great help, since my lack of English does not allow me to fully understand what he mentions in his videos. Possibly this in my third part of Sade Sati, I do not know exactly from the understanding of the Nakshatras, and this November 16 I entered instead of dasa in the solar period. The saturn traffic has been deficient, it is unbelievable as in this period it puts you in situations where the only exit option is patience, acceptance, faith, forgiveness and forgiveness of guilt. It seems that with saturn we can be certain that the lesson will be learned. Thank you for the councils, I will keep you in mind to make this experience more enriching.",155.0,1,1 year ago

Unexpected bills and cost at the moment as I am having intense sadesati. Some unfair judgement from government officials. Also cars repairs as saturn is my 4th lord. I'm working with old people with serious medical conditions as charity. All the time I have intense pressure to put up my own firm/company and luckily I know this is not the time. Also feel very restless as if I should move away from my country. Komillas words about that you have a feeling to do ALOT of things or to be done is exactly how I feel.,96.0,2,5 months ago (edited)
Hi Komilla  A question for you I'm having a hard time finding clarification on.  Does Sade Sati begin when Saturn enters the 25th Nakshatra or when it enters the 12th house? My birth Nakshatra is Satabhishak so I believe my 25th Nakshatra is Purva Ashadha and falls in the 11th house from the moon. Curious about the thinking about this.,60.0,2,1 year ago (edited)

"I am very happy to hear that you caught this about Saturn's energy as well. Just before moving to certain house, it makes us do things for that house but the right thing is not to do. When in 5th house, we indulge in lot of food and catch certain disease when it moves to 6th; when in 6th, we start ignoring partnership and end up in serious fights when it moves to 7th. This energy somehow makes us do it! I consider Saade Saati as extremely auspicious. It is must in order for one to be able to survive life. It breaks ego and illusions. It grounds us to practical aspects of life and shows consequences of our each and every action. It concretes the mind if Moon and/or Mercury are afflicted and we are all over the place in early ages. Saade Saati & Saturn Return transformed me in and out as a human being.",157.0,1,5 months ago (edited)

Saturn also has the lowest total number of 39, the same as my Mars total also 39. Jupiter has the highest total and I've had some tough things happen during this dasha.

Saturn is one of those planets you can’t make it easier... Only perhaps that you know you will pass through a difficult time that will eventually pass and that’s it. Also the difficulty of it might also depend on one’s individual karma. I was born during sade sati and am now in my second one. I am also in rahu dasha and it is indeed an unexpected time like it is said in the video. I’m in the last phase of it and know that it was all necessary and for me I had a lot of karma which is resolving itself... Sounds simple but it is not. For me these were the most transforming times of my life.,119.0,1,1 year ago

"Komillaji Pranam!  Wish we had your advise before we went through this extremely painful period. Me and my wife both are sagittarius moon making things difficult for us many folds as both are facing SS. Mine 7th house gemini lagna and hers 11th house aquarius lagna. Before SS began we were extremely devoted and very loving couple both working in MNC at decent levels and were married for 15 years.  1st phase SS started in Nov 14. My wife changed her job in Oct 14 and we shifted to new house in Nov 14 and this new house was extremely comfortable for us so as to help us and prepare us to pass the extremely difficult time which was about to come. We never faced any financial trouble although. I left my job to start my own venture in July 15 which seems to be a very good opportunity but soon after flying start it stopped abruptly but without any losses. From two earning sources, my wife remained the only one but her salary was decent enough for us to survive.  But then in Ap 16 she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Hell broke loose as we were extremely healthy and health conscious couple not at all earlier having experience of any kind of health complication. She had to go through major surgery, chemotherapy and radiation for next 9 months. My In-laws who were in their late eighties and early nineties, quite old and much prone to regular health issues were also staying with us as my wife is the only daughter. There was a time when my wife was having chemo, we had to hospitalize her mother for severe infection and after 15 days of hospitalization doctor said she would not survive more than 2 months, but later we took her home and she was totally bedridden for next 3 months but survived. Sametime her father's condition deteriorated and he was confined to bed needing toilet help on the bed itself. If this was not enough our only daughter got viral fever and I was only left to catch the infection from her later and hence every member was ill with one small child, two extremely old and one cancer patient undergoing treatment who was suppose to stay away from any of infection during her chemo.  My wife continued with her job in such condition but due to her treatment and her hormone treatment, become extremely bitter and harsh and was unable to bear the proximity of anybody who comes near to her including myself. Her bitterness took toll on our relationship which is under extreme stress as my moon is in 7th house.  But the strange thing which happened, although  I was not much aware about astrology, but was told by an astrologer 2 months prior that my wife has to face near life-death situation because of the markesh in her birth chart and advised the resolutions which I did. Matter of fact did what who so ever advised. Health wise she has recovered much, but on mental plane she still is in lot of pain and we are awaiting the 3rd phase and see what it has in store for us.",534.0,3,1 year ago
